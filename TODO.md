# TODO

Below is a TODO list for further development of `next-auth-lightning-provider`.

### Beta

- difference between set and update? does it throw if there isn't already an entry for k1? Is it supposed to? etc
- manual testing
  - test node, next, next-auth versions for compatibility (including deployed)
  - test all user configuration options
- tidy up READMEs
  - add BTC address to contributors section of readme
  - add suggestion: cleaning up old and unused lnauth session data that was created but never reached success state.

### Release

- open PR on `next-auth`
- add more example repos
- Once `next-auth@v5` is out of beta, ensure it's supported.

##### Checklist

- bump version
- commit with git
- build with npm
- publish with npm
- release on github

### Back-burner

Stuff I may or may not get around to:

- allow query params to be passed into the pages config options
- add `auto` color scheme that user browser's preferred dark/light settings
- consider adding various styles of avatar and name generators
- consider / investigate how to SSR react components so the `vanilla.ts` shim can be deprecated
- add JSDocs comments to all internally used functions
- add comments to code
- 404 page?
- make jest typescript settings the same as project
- add extra tests for difficult code like signin / diagnostics pages, hooks, vanilla js etc.
- look into dicebear console warnings in `ui-pages-router` example when running when running locally (they don't appear when when installed via npm, so low priority)
- implement CSRF for poll and create endpoints (the rest are either GET requests or made under the `next-auth` hood, e.g. `token` request)
- add yellow notes to diagram in README
- tidy up usage of type casting
